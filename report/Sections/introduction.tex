\section{Introduction}
This homework requires us to implement the Q-Learning algorithm presented in the paper ``A Q-Learning-Based Topology-Aware Routing Protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks''  by Arafat and Moh.
The paper presents a location-based routing which not only utilizes the information of single-hop neighbors but also uses the information of two-hop neighbors.
