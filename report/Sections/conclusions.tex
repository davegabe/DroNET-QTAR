\section{Conclusions}
In this homework, we have implemented the QTAR algorithm and compared it to the algorithms of the previous homework.
The results show that the QTAR algorithm is not performing as well as the Q-Learning algorithm or the Georouting algorithm.
This is because in our problem we know the exact position of the destination (the depot) and we know that this position won't change during simulation.

QTAR algorithm in fact has been developed to achieve a different task, which is to find the best path to reach a destination drone that is moving.
In our case, the destination drone is static and we know its position, so the QTAR algorithm is not the best choice.
